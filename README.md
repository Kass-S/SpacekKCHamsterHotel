//created a responsive website based on given figma

### Peer Review:
**Name**: Michael Heckerman
**Review**:     Desktop matched the mockup pretty closely. I liked the way you had the drop down menu for the navbar when it hit tablet and mobile. There was a issue when you go to a smaller size screen for desktop (1024 x 1180), the hamster image in the award section doesn't scale with the rest of the content. Also the image for the reserve room section seems a bit stretched, the button seems to be floating a bit on the desktop version. Other then those small things the site seems responsive on all screen sizes. Good Job.
